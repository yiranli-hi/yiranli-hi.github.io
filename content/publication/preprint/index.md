abstract: 'Little is known about the association between autism and cardiometabolic conditions across the lifespan. We conducted the largest cohort study, using Dutch register data of 8,690,286 individuals aged 12-65 years. These individuals were followed up from January 1, 2014 to their first incidence of cardiometabolic conditions, emigration, death, or December 31, 2020. Cox proportional-hazards models indicated autism was associated with higher risks of cardiometabolic conditions (hazard ratio (HR): 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-1.23, specifically hypertension (HR: 1.16; CI: 1.14-1.19), dyslipidemia (HR: 1.17; CI: 1.12-1.23), diabetes (HR: 1.22; CI: 1.14-1.30), stroke (HR: 1.23; CI: 1.14-1.34), and heart failure (HR: 1.28; CI: 1.07-1.53). Sex-stratified findings were similar. Associations were observed in adolescent, young (18-30 years), and middle-aged (31-40 years), but not older individuals, indicating earlier onset in autistic compared to non-autistic individuals. Our results underscore the need of monitoring and treatment of cardiometabolic conditions among individuals with autism.'

Drived by this work, a follow-up familial study was conducted [previous paper](/publication/conference-paper/) on familial co-aggregation between autism, ADHD, and cardiometabolic conditions.
